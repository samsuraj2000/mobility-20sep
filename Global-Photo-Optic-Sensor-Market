# 1. Introduction to Photo Optic Sensors Introduction In this chapter, we will introduce the photo optic sensors commonly referred to as optical sensors. These are devices that convert light into an electronic signal. These sensors function based on the principles of optics and photodetection and are used to detect and measure parameters like light intensity, displacement, color, and presence of objects. The basic function of a photo optic sensor is the emission of light from an optical source that interacts with an object or a surface and such an interaction is detected by a sensor that transforms the light into an electrical signal to be processed.

# 2. Market Drivers
There are several factors that are growing the global photo optic sensor market:

Increasing Industrial Automation: Photo optic sensors are mainly used in the varied industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and packaging. They ensure that the object detection through such sensors is highly accurate so that jobs such as sorting, assembling, and quality control are conducted.

Increasing Demand for Consumer Electronics: As smartphone and tablet usage are proliferating, proximity detection, ambient light sensing, and biometric scanning applications (e.g., facial recognition) have popularized optic photo sensors.

Expansion of the Automotive Industry: Now, the automotive industry is vast in terms of the use of advanced driver-assistance systems that are highly dependent on optical sensors. ADAS-based functionalities for applications such as lane departure warning, adaptive lighting, and pedestrian detection have been predominant.
